# Bike Share Data Analysis Model

In this code pattern, we will be analyzing data provided by Motivate, a bike share system provider for many major cities in the United States, 

to uncover bike share usage patterns. 

We  will compare the system usage between three large cities: Chicago, New York City, and Washington.

## Flow

1. User answers which filter he wants to sort data by; 0-->Day, 1 --> Month, 2 --> Day and Month, 3 --> No filter.
2. It computes then variety of discriptive statistics ex: (Popular times of travel,...etc)
3. User then decides if he needs to show raw data or not.
4. User can restart all commands allover again.

## Prerequisites

* python 3.0++ ,and pandas installed, and files: new_york_city.csv, chicago.csv, washington.csv, and bikeshare.py
